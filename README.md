# Interpretable-3D-Modeling Research
Personal repository to track my PhD research. Based on [Yagami360/MachineLearning-Papers_Survey](https://github.com/Yagami360/MachineLearning-Papers_Survey).

Each paper summary is under Issues. 
- Papers I intend to start soon are labeled TODO
- Process is labeled by percentage 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%

## ■ NeRF uncertainty

### ◎ Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields
