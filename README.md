# Interpretable-3D-Modeling Research
Personal repository to track my PhD research. Based on [Yagami360/MachineLearning-Papers_Survey](https://github.com/Yagami360/MachineLearning-Papers_Survey).

Each paper summary is under Issues. 
- Papers I intend to start soon are labeled TODO
- Process is labeled by percentage 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%

## 3D Vision Tasks

### Novel View Synthesis (NVS)

### Multi View Stereo (MVS) 

- [NeuralMVS: Bridging Multi-View Stereo and Novel
View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03880.pdf) (distinguish MVS from NVS)

## Uncertainty related 
<hr />

### Already Published

Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields:

- [Stochastic Neural Radiance Fields: Quantifying Uncertainty in Implicit 3D Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02123)

- [Conditional-Flow NeRF: Accurate 3D Modelling with Reliable Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10192)

### Next work

- choose [faster nerf framework](https://github.com/poetrywanderer/Interpretable-3D-Modeling/blob/main/Faster-NeRF/Faster_NeRF.md)(TODO) to achieve real time uncertainty estimation

- achieve [active learning](dsa)(TODO) using uncertainty
