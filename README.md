# Interpretable-3D-Modeling Research
Personal repository to track my PhD research. Based on [Yagami360/MachineLearning-Papers_Survey](https://github.com/Yagami360/MachineLearning-Papers_Survey).

Each paper summary is under Issues. 
- Papers I intend to start soon are labeled TODO
- Process is labeled by percentage 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%

### Next work

uncertainty [application](https://github.com/poetrywanderer/Interpretable-3D-Modeling/blob/main/Uncertainty_applications.md):

- choose [faster nerf framework](https://github.com/poetrywanderer/Interpretable-3D-Modeling/blob/main/Faster-NeRF/Faster_NeRF.md)(TODO) to achieve real time uncertainty estimation

- achieve [active learning](https://github.com/poetrywanderer/Interpretable-3D-Modeling/blob/main/Uncertainty_applications.md)(TODO) using uncertainty
